# Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles (IoV)

This project implements a machine learning based intrusion detection system to identify cyber attacks in vehicular networks.

## Objective
To detect malicious network activity in IoV environments using tree-based machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature selection
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
Tree-based models demonstrated strong performance in detecting intrusion patterns.
